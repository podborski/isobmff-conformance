Part 12;
Box-structure;This set of tests covers the basic box structure which is common to all the specifications in the family.
Ordinary box;Regular boxes with 4CC, no UUID, and a 32-bit explicit length
64-bit length;Box(es) with 64-bit lengths (typically mdat)
implied length (size=0);Box with the length running to end of file (last box)
FTYP box;Basic FTYP box handling
UUID box;A user box using a UUID type (should be ignored if not recognized)
Free/skip;Free space (two box types)
Unknown box;A box with an 'unknown' code is present in the file and should be ignored.  The box type used for testing could be one of 'junk', 'mess', etc.
;
Movies;This set of tests covers files with 'moov' atoms, used in MP4 and AVC.
Movie box;A movie box with all its required contents, and at least one track.
normal' order (moov-mdat);Boxes in the 'usual' order for reading, and in the recommended order inside
late' order (mdat first);The 'mdat' first and the 'moov' late, and boxes in the 'moov' in funny order.
64-bit mv/tr/md headers;There are 64-bit versions of the movie, track, and media headers, that allow long durations and dates after 2040.
track enabled bit;The track-enabled bit in the track header.
track reference;Track references of some kind are used.
track group;Track groups of some kind are used
edit list;An edit list is used on at least one track, and some material in the media is edited out.
video track;There is a video track with video headers
audio track;There is an audio track with audio headers
meta-data track;A timed meta-data track
unknown track type;An unknown type of track should be ignored (handler='junk' etc.)
unknown codec type;An unknown audio or video codec is used (sample entry name is 'junk' etc.)
image track (no sync table);A track with a single image in it.
data ref to other file;Data reference atoms using URLs or URNs are used to refer to media in other files.
compact stz2;The compact sample size box is used.
64-bit chunks;The 64-bit version of the chunk offset table is used, and the chunk offsets have non-zero bits in their upper 32 bits.
ctts offsets;At least one track uses composition re-ordering.
sync table;At least one track (video, probably) has sync samples marked
pad bits;At least one track (audio, probably) has a padding bits table for non byte-lengthed Aus
degr. Priority;A degradation priority table is used (note that the meaning of the priority values is not established by standard).
sample groups;A sample group description and sample to group tables are present.
pre-roll group;The pre-roll sample group is present ('roll')
ipmp control;The IPMP control box is present
sub-sample information;The sub-sample information box (sub-sample structure) is present

Protected streams (IPMP);Protected streams using the IPMP protection boxes are present
sample scale box;The sample scale box (presenting video hint) is present
progressive dnload box;The progressive download hitn box is present
shadow sync;the shadow sync box (deprecated) is present
Copyright box;A user-data copyright statement is present
Interleaved data;The media data is interleaved on a sensible scale (e.g. .5 second) and in order
Two or more mdats;two or more mdat boxes are present
sample dependency;The sample dependency table is present
several sample description;There is one track ujsing several sample entries, not just one
;
movie fragments;Movie fragments boxes are tested
Movie fragment box;Basic movie fragments (movie extends, moof, traf, and trun)
mov. Ext header;The optional movie extends header is present
fragment random access;The optional Fragment random access box is present
64-bit fragments;Fragments are used in combination with 64-bit offsets
;

file-level;Meta box at file level
movie-level;Meta box at movie level
track-level;Meta box at track level
basic protected meta-data;Some meta-data is protected using the basic techniques
ipmp protected meta-data;Some meta-data is protected using IPMP boxes
data refs;Some meta-data is in external files and linked by data references
item naming etc.;Some items use the item information (name etc.) box
;
Hint tracks;This section tests hint tracks.
