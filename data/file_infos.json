FX-VY-9436R.3_qhd.mp4 is the ISOBMFF media track and FX-VY-9436R.3_qhd-variant.mp4 is the associated variant track, ISOBMFF metadata track. These files rely on the “external context” option for associating a variant track to a media track.  As such, there is no Track Reference box within the media track to make that association. The keys for decrypting the content are in the XML file, FX-VY-9436R.3_qhd.vinput.merged.xml, in Keyset Delivery Format (KDF).  The KDF file contains the collection of all keys used to create the files, including all media and metadata keys for the purpose of providing all the information as conformance file. Typically, an individual player/decoder would receive just the subset of keys that particular player needs."

The video contained in the segment is only black frames (with some text in the top right), to avoid licensing issues. The information in the colour box matches the VUI, but since there is a VUI and an SEI and HLG is in effect we see two colour boxes with identical colour primaries and matrix coefficients, but the first documents the HLG transfer function and the second the BT.2020 code-point for standard gamma (i.e. the same as 709)."
